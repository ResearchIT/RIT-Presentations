Using & contributing to Open Source tools,
and ~~following~~ attempting gitops allows
our small team (approx 5 FTE)
to provide Research Computing support to
a few hundred research groups.

* A grid of bespoke high performance servers (managed with Ansible Tower)
* Large Scale Storage (ZFS on Linux)
* Fast scratch (Lustre on ZFS)
* Self-service VM's (RHV)
* Container platform (OKD)
* Over 1K Software modules (Spack & Singularity)
  * Interested in further automating this
* Research computing grid & University MRI clusters all share the same OS, modules, and methods
