# Large Scale Storage (LSS):
## Reliable, affordable research storage

LSS is a storage solution for research data, managed as a joint project between ITS & LAS IT.

### What it is:
.small[
* $40/TB/Year (15x less expensive than Isilon)
* Local error checking, snapshots, & offsite backup (ZFSonLinux on RHEL)
* Research groups/labs who have large quantities of data that is not feasible or cost effective to store in the cloud
* Groups willing to follow the standard permission model (lab/project group rw access)
* Accessible from Windows, Mac, Linux, HPC (samba share, some exceptions for NFS)
]

### What it is not:
.small[
* Not for user home/profile directories
* Not for 'High' or 'Restricted' data classification (without prior discussion)
* Not for departmental administrative business
]
