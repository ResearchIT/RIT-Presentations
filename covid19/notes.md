Hi, my name is Levi Baber, and I manage the Research IT team.

My presentation is not directly related to covid-19 research, but 
is meant to be a quick overview of campus IT resources
available to help facilitate research.

I have broken my presentation into three sections typical in many research projects

# Phase 1: software development

We have a relatively new self-service virtual server environment
This allows you and members of your team to create VMs without intervation from IT.
Please follow the link for the sign up form if you're interested. 
There is currently no cost for this service, but resources are limited.

The other imporant point is version control. We strongly encourage you to use version control 
from the very beginning of your project.  GitHub has made this easy by making organzational accounts with
private repositories free for academic use. Contact is if you need help getting this setup.

Phase 2: Analysis

We have several large pools of servers available on campus for computational analysis.

We can onboard users to these resources very quickly and help them scale up analysis that has outgrown their personal computers.

We have several data storage options on campus, and it can sometimes be confusing which one to use.  To try to make that easier, I want to point
out our top recommendations:

If you need cloud storage for research, google drive is free for iowa state users

Large Scale Storage (LSS) is our on campus research storage solution
The cost is very low, and allows for very large datasets

Phase 3: Publication

sites.iastate.edu is the University's solution for providing each faculty with a web space to publish a CV, share lab information, etc.
You can also share your research on these sites

openshift is our platform for web application hosting using kubernetes and docker. This lets us quickly deploy sites in a secure way, with maximum flexibility
for researchers.  One of tomorrow's presenters has used this platform to deploy a shiny dashboard for covid-19.

Finally, if you need somewhere to deposit a dataset for public access, please contact the Library about DataShare, their ISU branded FigShare platform.
